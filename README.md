# LiquidBounce Scripts
Scripts for the LiquidBounce client.

Made this because I was bored.

You can support the repo by starring, and you can add more scripts by creating pull requests.

All the credits go to their original authors.

If a script doesn't work, do not create an issue about it as I'm not the owner of the scripts in the repo.

All of the scripts in this repository are checked and safe.

The scripts in this repository are compatible with LiquidBounce forks.

## I ain't focusing on this shit too much anymore.
