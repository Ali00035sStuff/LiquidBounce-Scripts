# LiquidBounce Scripts
Scripts for LiquidBounce client

Made this because I was bored.

You can support the repo by starring, and you can add more scripts.

All the credits go to their original authors

If a script doesn't work, do not create an issue about it as I'm not the owner of the scripts in the repo.
